    I don't use this code for personal purposes, it's just a practical matter!!.
    
   This code can be used in different scenarios where you need to manage a collection of change-tracking data. Here are some practical applications:
   1. Data Management with change Tracking (Data Management with Event Handling)
   2. Data storage in game applications (Game Data Storage)
   3. Implementation of event logging (Event Logging System)
   4. Data buffer for asynchronous operations (Asynchronous Data Buffer)
   5. Testing and prototyping of functions (Prototyping and Testing)
   6. Implementation of Undo/Redo functionality
   7. Implementation of the Observer Pattern
